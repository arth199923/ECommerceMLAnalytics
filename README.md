# E-Commerce Marketing Insights

## Business Context:

In the competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer behavior and optimizing marketing strategies is vital for sustained growth. This project focuses on leveraging data-driven insights to define effective marketing strategies and enhance business performance.

## Available Data:

The repository includes multiple datasets covering transaction data, customer demographics, discount coupons, marketing spend, tax details, and more. These datasets enable detailed analyses and modeling to extract meaningful insights.

## Business Objective:

1. **Calculate Invoice Amount:** Compute invoice value or revenue for each transaction and item level based on relevant factors such as quantity, price, discounts, GST, and delivery charges.

2. **Perform Detailed Exploratory Analysis:** Conduct thorough exploratory analysis to understand various aspects including customer acquisition, retention, revenue trends, discount impact, key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends by category/location/month/day, and more.

3. **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers using heuristic (value-based, RFM) and scientific (K-Means) methods to tailor marketing strategies for different customer segments.

4. **Predict Customer Lifetime Value:** Predict customer lifetime value (low value, medium value, high value) using classification models based on historical customer revenue data.

5. **Cross-Selling Analysis:** Explore cross-selling opportunities by analyzing market basket data to identify product combinations that are frequently purchased together.

6. **Predict Next Purchase Day:** Build classification models to predict the next purchase day for customers based on their historical purchase behavior.

7. **Perform Cohort Analysis:** Analyze customer cohorts to understand behavior patterns and retention rates over time.

## Expected Outputs:

- Detailed code with comments for each analysis and model.
- Comprehensive documentation of methodologies, findings, and recommendations.
- Analytical dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and business metrics.
- Predictive models for customer lifetime value, cross-selling, and next purchase day.
- Insights and recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies and improving business performance.
